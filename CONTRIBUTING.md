## Leave a star and watch the project

Become a stargazer ! Click on the star button.
Even if that's a ridiculous number, it helps me know how many people like the idea. If you don't wanna be spammed with emails, that's the perfect choice.

However, if you want to follow a bit closer the development of the project, you definitely should watch the project. If you don't know already, GitHub allows you to watch only issues, only PRs... Select what you want receive !

You can fork the project too if you plan on creating a pull request a bit later.
